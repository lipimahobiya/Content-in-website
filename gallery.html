    <h2>SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>
    <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <img src = "mercury 88.jpg">
    <p>Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, is a rocky world with a cratered surface similar to
    Earth's Moon. It orbits the sun rapidly, completing a year in just 88 Earth days, and its day-night cycle is unusually
    long, taking 59 Earth days. Mercury's extreme temperatures, ranging from scorching highs to frigid lows, are due to its
    lack of a substantial atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <img src = "venus.jpg">
    <p>Venus, the second planet from the sun, is Earth's closest planetary neighbor and is known as the "Earth's twin" due to
    its similar size and mass. It's also the hottest planet in our solar system, with a surface temperature hot enough to
    melt lead, and is shrouded in a thick, toxic atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds.</p>

    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <img src = "earth.jpg">
    <p>Earth, our home planet, is the third from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life, often called the
    "blue planet" due to its abundant water. It's a dynamic sphere, characterized by a rocky crust, a molten mantle, and a
    solid inner core. Earth's atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, protects it from harmful solar
    radiation and sustains life. Our planet's rotation causes day and night, while its orbit around the sun defines seasons
    and the year. The Earth's unique combination of factors, including its distance from the sun, its atmosphere, and the
    presence of water, makes it a habitable haven in the vastness of space.</p>

    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <img src = "mars.jpg">
    <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its rusty-red surface, caused by iron
    oxide dust. It's a cold, rocky, and dry world with a thin atmosphere, and its surface is marked by canyons, volcanoes,
    and craters. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and a day on Mars is slightly longer than Earth's, while a year is
    almost twice as long. Scientists are intrigued by the possibility of past or even present life on Mars, given its
    potential for past water and similarities to Earth.</p>
    
    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <img src = "jupiter.jpg">
    <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system and a gas giant, is known for its swirling cloud stripes and the Great
    Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for centuries. It's the fifth planet from the sun and is composed primarily of
    hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface, and is twice as massive as all other planets combined.</p>

    <h3>Saturn</h3>
    <img src="sat.jpg">
    <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest in our solar system, is a gas giant known for its
    spectacular ring system, which is made of ice and dust particles. It's also the farthest planet visible to the naked eye
    and is named after the Roman god of agriculture.</p>

    <h3>Uranus</h3>
    <img src = "ur.jpg">
    <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is a unique ice giant characterized by its blue-green color, a result of
    methane in its atmosphere, and a distinctive axial tilt, making it appear to rotate on its side. It's also the
    third-largest planet in our solar system and is known for its faint rings and numerous moons, some of which are named
    after.</p>

    <h3>Neptune</h3>
    <img src = "neptune.jpg">
    <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a dark, cold, and windy ice giant, known for its vibrant blue
    color due to methane in its atmosphere. It's more than 30 times farther from the sun than Earth and has the strongest
    winds in our solar system.</p>
