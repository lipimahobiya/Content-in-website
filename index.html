    <h1>SPACE EXPLORATION</h1>  
    <img src = "Space  777.jpg" >
    <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is
    often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless
    four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to
    an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
    itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.
    
    In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is
    conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general
    relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.[3] Experimental tests of general relativity
    have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.[citation needed]
    
    Philosophy of space
    Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises
    like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the
    Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception
    of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath
    Alhazen.[4] Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in
    the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics.
    
    Isaac Newton viewed space as absolute, existing permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in it.[5]
    In contrast, other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought that space was in fact a collection of
    relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher
    and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory
    of Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones
    derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans
    possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his Critique of Pure Reason
    as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition".
    
    Galileo
    Galilean and Cartesian theories about space, matter, and motion are at the foundation of the Scientific Revolution,
    which is understood to have culminated with the publication of Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687.[6] Newton's
    theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the
    most influential in physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.[7]
    
    As one of the pioneers of modern science, Galileo revised the established Aristotelian and Ptolemaic ideas about a
    geocentric cosmos. He backed the Copernican theory that the universe was heliocentric, with a stationary Sun at the
    center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the Sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that
    its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galileo wanted to prove instead that the Sun moved around
    its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galileo, celestial bodies,
    including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all
    objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.[8]</p>
